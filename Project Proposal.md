# Project Proposal

Connie Xiao


Spotify's new feature engine, 'Enhance', has gathered a lot of attention, claiming that it will curate the 'perfect' playlist for each individual user. Once you turn on Enhance, Spotify analyses your playlist and adds extra songs that fit in perfectly with the vibe. For this project, I wanted to explore and create Spotfiy's song recommeder engine. I have always wondered how Spotify recommends songs and playlists based on your listening history. To do so, I will be using Spotify's Web API Spotipy. Then I will deploy the model via app using Streamlit or Dash. Given a certain song, the recommendation engine will return the top 50 songs related to the input song.
